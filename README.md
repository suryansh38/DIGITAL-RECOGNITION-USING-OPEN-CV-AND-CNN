Digit Recognition using Computer Vision and opencv

The project aims at detecting the pattern made by the motion of fingers in air to form digits from 0 to 9.
The motion of fingers is captured through webcam and then opencv is used for preprocessing the image.
The preprocessed image is then fed into a CNN classifier that classifies digits from 0 to 9.
